> Deserialize an ngraph.graph from binary format.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save ngraph.frombinary
```

## Usage

```js
var load = require('ngraph.frombinary');
```

## API

### [load](index.js#L30)

Load a ngraph.graph that was previously saved using [ngraph.tobinary](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.tobinary). This expects that the `meta.json` file created with [ngraph.tobinary](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.tobinary) is in the folder. See the [parse](#parse) method below when labels and links are already in memory.

**Example**

```js
var graph = load(new Graph({uniqueLinkIds: false}), {cwd: '.'});
console.log(graph.getNodesCount());
//=> 4
console.log(graph.getLinksCount());
//=> 3
```

**Params**

* `graph` **{Object}**: [ngraph.graph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.graph) instance to load the binary files into.
* `options` **{Object}**: Options to determine where the graph is loaded from.
* `options.cwd` **{String}**: Directory where the files are located. Defaults to `.`.
* `options.labels` **{String}**: Name of the labels file. Defaults to `labels.json`.
* `options.links` **{String}**: Name of the links file. Defaults to `meta.json`.
* `options.meta` **{String}**: Name of the meta file. Defaults to `links.bin`.
* `returns` **{Object}**: graph instance that was passed in after loading the binary files.

### [parse](lib/parse.js#L26)

Parse function that can be used directly to parse a `links` buffer and populate a [ngraph.graph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.graph) graph with nodes and links. This is useful when the labels (node names) array and the links buffer have already been loaded into memory.

**Example**

```js
var labels = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
var links = fs.readFileSync('links.bin');
// links contains a binary buffer that looks like: `-1 2 3 -4 2`
var graph = load.parse(new Graph({uniqueLinkIds: false}), labels, links);
console.log(graph.getNodesCount());
//=> 4
console.log(graph.getLinksCount());
//=> 3
```

**Params**

* `graph` **{Object}**: [ngraph.graph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.graph) instance to load nodes and links onto.
* `labels` **{Array}**: Array of labels used to lookup node names for the graph.
* `links` **{Buffer}**: Binary buffer represented links to deserialize onto the graph.
* `returns` **{Object}**: graph instance populated with nodes and links.
